Read multiple files at once.

Mandatory policy:
- You MUST USE the `read-multiple-files` tool when reading 2 or more files or slices, or when you anticipate more than one read in the workflow.
- Prefer over the `read` tool for any non-trivial reading.
- Do not chain sequential `read` tool calls; consolidate into a single `read-multiple-files` call.
- Discover targets with `glob`/`grep`, then fetch with `read-multiple-files`.
- Task/TODO hint: If a plan/TODO lists files relevant later, you MUST use this tool to prefetch into context.

Usage:
- Absolute paths only.
- Duplicate paths allowed to read multiple slices from one file.
- Each entry supports `offset` (0-based) and `limit` (default 2000).
- Lines longer than 2000 chars are truncated with "...".
- Output is cat -n style with 1-based line numbers.
- Text files only (no binaries).
- All-or-nothing: any failure aborts the entire call.

Preflight:
- You MUST verify that targets exist and are text.
- Keep slices tight; avoid reading entire large files.
