Edit multiple files at once.

Mandatory policy:
- You MUST USE the `apply-multiple-edits` tool when performing 2 or more edits within a single file OR when editing 2 or more files.
- Prefer over the `edit` tool unless there is exactly one change in exactly one file.
- Do not chain multiple `edit` tool calls; consolidate into a single `apply-multiple-edits` call.

Before you run:
1. You MUST read (using the `read` or `read-multiple-files` tool) the current contents and capture the exact `oldString` (include stable surrounding context).
2. Verify paths exist and order edits so earlier replacements do not break later matches.

Behavior:
- Sequential within each file; each edit sees prior results.
- All-or-nothing across all files; any failure aborts everything.
- Cannot create files.

Requirements:
- `oldString` must match exactly (including whitespace); `newString` must differ.
- Anchor matches with surrounding context to make them unique.
- Use `replaceAll` only when changing every occurrence is unquestionably safe.

Guidance:
- Keep changes minimal and idiomatic.
- Use absolute file paths.
