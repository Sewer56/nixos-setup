Write multiple files at once.

Mandatory policy:
- You MUST USE the `write-multiple` tool when creating or overwriting 2 or more files.
- Prefer over the `write` tool for any multi-file write.
- Do not chain multiple `write` tool calls; consolidate into a single `write-multiple` call.
- Prefer the `edit`/`edit-multiple` tools for partial modifications; use `write-multiple` to create files or replace entire contents.
- Task/TODO hint: If a plan/TODO lists files relevant later, you MUST use this tool to prefetch targets and batch the writes.

Behavior:
- Transactional: either all files are written or none; on failure, originals are restored (new dirs may remain).
- Absolute paths only; parent directories are created if missing.
- If content is unchanged, the write may be skipped.

Constraints:
- If overwriting, you MUST have read the file earlier in the session.
- Never create docs (*.md, README) unless explicitly requested.
- No emojis unless explicitly requested.
- Keep writes within the workspace and the requested scope.
