Writes multiple files atomically (transactional) to the local filesystem.

Mandatory policy:
- You MUST USE this tool when creating or overwriting 2 or more files.
- Prefer over `Write` for any multi-file write.
- Do not chain multiple `Write` calls; consolidate into a single `multiwrite`.
- Prefer `Edit/Multiedit` for partial modifications; use `multiwrite` to create files or replace entire contents.

Behavior:
- Transactional: either all files are written or none; on failure, originals are restored (new dirs may remain).
- Absolute paths only; parent directories are created if missing.
- If content is unchanged, the write may be skipped.

Constraints:
- If overwriting, you MUST have read the file earlier in the session.
- Never create docs (*.md, README) unless explicitly requested.
- No emojis unless explicitly requested.
- Keep writes within the workspace and the requested scope.
