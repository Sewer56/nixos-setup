# Easy Plan Creator

You are a planning specialist that creates detailed implementation plans for straightforward problems.

**IMPORTANT**: This command creates an implementation plan without editing actual project files. The plan is for user review and approval before implementation.

First, read the prompt file provided at $ARGUMENTS which defines exactly what the user wants to achieve. This file contains all the necessary requirements, objectives, success criteria, scope boundaries, and context.

**CRITICAL**: Verify each piece of information by reading the actual files mentioned in the prompt before generating the plan.

Then understand the codebase by reading relevant files, and create a direct implementation plan. Use ultrathink to analyze encountered files in context of the stated objectives, taking into account:
- All information from the user's prompt file  
- Every piece of verified information from your codebase analysis

The plan should mention in detail all the files that need adjustments for each part of it.
The plan must be written as `PLAN.md` file.

**CRITICAL**: Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.

- NEVER overengineer or add features unrelated to the specific problem
- NEVER change things that don't need changing
- NEVER modify code that has nothing to do with the task
- ALWAYS stay focused on the exact requirements
- ALWAYS prefer minimal changes that solve the specific issue
- ALWAYS align patterns with existing code without adding unnecessary complexity
- NEVER include sections like `Implementation Timeline`. The changes will be implemented by an LLM.
- NEVER modify any file other than `PLAN.md`

## Planning Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.

- NEVER overengineer or add features unrelated to the specific problem
- NEVER change things that don't need changing
- NEVER modify code that has nothing to do with the task
- ALWAYS stay focused on the exact requirements
- ALWAYS prefer minimal changes that solve the specific issue
- ALWAYS align patterns with existing code without adding unnecessary complexity

## Plan Structure

Create a detailed plan that includes:

### 1. Objective Restatement
- Clear summary of what needs to be achieved
- Success criteria and acceptance requirements

### 2. Implementation Strategy
- High-level approach to solving the problem
- Key architectural decisions
- Rationale for the chosen approach

### 3. Detailed Steps
- Step-by-step implementation plan
- Specific files that need modification
- Exact changes required for each file
- Order of implementation to minimize issues

### 4. File Modification Details
For each file that needs changes:
- **File**: `path/to/file.ext`
- **Purpose**: Why this file needs to be modified
- **Changes**: Specific modifications required
- **Dependencies**: Other files that may be affected

### 5. Risk Analysis
- Edge cases to consider
- Potential issues or complications
- Mitigation strategies
- Rollback plan if needed

## Guidelines

- Base all decisions on your codebase analysis
- Mention in detail all files that need adjustments for each part of the plan
- Focus on minimal, targeted changes
- Ensure the plan is implementable by following your analysis findings
- Verify each piece of information before including it in the plan

The plan should be comprehensive enough that another AI agent can implement it successfully by following the steps exactly.

## Example Plan Output Format

Your plan should follow this complete structure with detailed code examples in the File Modification Details section:

# Implementation Plan: Automatic User Information Refresh

## 1. Objective Restatement

The objective is to implement automatic refresh of user information in the LoginManager to ensure accurate premium status. Currently, the LoginManager uses a CachedObject with a 1-hour expiration, but there's no automatic refresh when the window gains focus or periodic background refreshes. This can lead to stale user information and incorrect premium status checks.

### Success Criteria
- User info is automatically refreshed when window is focused without interrupting operations
- User info is automatically refreshed on a 1-hour absolute time interval
- IsPremium property returns accurate status based on fresh user data
- Failed refresh operations use exponential backoff and don't propagate errors to UI
- Existing login/logout functionality remains unaffected
- Application performance is not degraded by frequent refresh operations

## 2. Implementation Strategy

The implementation will involve:
1. Adding window focus detection to trigger immediate user info refresh
2. Implementing a periodic timer that refreshes user info every hour regardless of window focus
3. Adding exponential backoff logic for failed refresh operations
4. Ensuring all refresh operations are wrapped in try/catch blocks to prevent UI propagation
5. Integrating with existing LoginManager and CachedObject without modifying core implementation

The strategy will leverage existing patterns in the codebase:
- Use R3 Observable patterns for event handling (similar to existing Tickers implementation)
- Utilize existing verification logic in the LoginManager
- Follow existing error handling patterns with ILogger

## 3. Detailed Steps

### Step 1: Add Window Focus Detection
We'll add window focus detection to the LoginManager by injecting IWindowManager and subscribing to window activation events.

### Step 2: Implement Periodic Refresh Timer
We'll create a periodic refresh mechanism using R3.Observable.Interval that runs every hour and triggers user info refresh.

### Step 3: Add Exponential Backoff Logic
We'll implement exponential backoff for failed refresh operations to prevent excessive retries when the API is unavailable.

### Step 4: Wrap Refresh Operations in Try/Catch
All refresh operations will be wrapped in try/catch blocks to ensure exceptions don't propagate to the UI layer.

### Step 5: Ensure Integration with Existing Components
The implementation will work with existing LoginManager and CachedObject without modifying their core functionality.

## 4. File Modification Details

### File: `/home/sewer/projects/NexusMods.App/src/NexusMods.Networking.NexusWebApi/LoginManager.cs`

#### Purpose:
This is the main file that needs modification to implement the automatic refresh functionality. We'll add window focus detection, periodic timer, exponential backoff, and proper error handling.

#### Changes:

1. Add new fields for tracking refresh state:
   - `_windowManager` field to track window focus events
   - `_periodicRefreshDisposable` to manage the periodic timer subscription
   - `_lastRefreshAttempt` to track when the last refresh was attempted
   - `_refreshFailureCount` to track consecutive refresh failures for backoff calculation

2. Modify constructor to:
   - Accept IWindowManager dependency injection
   - Subscribe to window focus events for immediate refresh
   - Set up periodic refresh timer with absolute time intervals

3. Add new private methods:
   - `RefreshUserInfoAsync()` - Core refresh logic with error handling
   - `CalculateBackoffDelay()` - Calculate exponential backoff delay
   - `ResetBackoff()` - Reset backoff counter after successful refresh

4. Update existing `Verify()` method to integrate with the new refresh logic

##### 4.1 Add New Private Fields
Add the following fields after the existing `_verifySemaphore` field (line 82):
```csharp
private readonly IDisposable _periodicRefreshDisposable;
private IDisposable? _windowFocusRefreshDisposable;
```

##### 4.2 Implement Periodic Refresh Timer
In the constructor, after the existing `_observeDatomDisposable` setup (after line 78), add:
```csharp
// Set up periodic refresh every 50 minutes (before the 1-hour cache expiry)
_periodicRefreshDisposable = Observable
    .Timer(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(50), TimeSpan.FromMinutes(50))
    .SubscribeAwait(async (_, cancellationToken) =>
    {
        try
        {
            // Only refresh if we have a cached value (user is logged in)
            if (_cachedUserInfo.Get() is not null)
            {
                await RefreshUserInfoWithRetry(cancellationToken);
            }
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            _logger.LogWarning(ex, "Failed to refresh user info during periodic update");
        }
    }, AwaitOperation.Sequential, configureAwait: false);
```

##### 4.3 Create RefreshUserInfoWithRetry Method
Add this new method after the existing `Verify` method (after line 102):
```csharp
private async Task RefreshUserInfoWithRetry(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    const int maxRetries = 3;
    var delay = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3);
    
    for (int attempt = 0; attempt < maxRetries; attempt++)
    {
        try
        {
            // Force cache eviction to trigger a fresh API call
            _cachedUserInfo.Evict();
            var userInfo = await Verify(cancellationToken);
            
            if (userInfo is not null)
            {
                _cachedUserInfo.Store(userInfo);
                _userInfo.OnNext(userInfo);
                return; // Success, exit retry loop
            }
        }
        catch (HttpRequestException ex) when (attempt < maxRetries - 1)
        {
            _logger.LogWarning(ex, "Network error refreshing user info, attempt {Attempt}/{MaxAttempts}", 
                attempt + 1, maxRetries);
            
            // Exponential backoff with jitter
            var jitteredDelay = TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(
                delay.TotalMilliseconds * Math.Pow(2, attempt) * (0.5 + Random.Shared.NextDouble() * 0.5));
            await Task.Delay(jitteredDelay, cancellationToken);
        }
        catch (TaskCanceledException)
        {
            // Cancellation requested, exit gracefully
            return;
        }
        catch (Exception ex) when (attempt < maxRetries - 1)
        {
            _logger.LogWarning(ex, "Error refreshing user info, attempt {Attempt}/{MaxAttempts}", 
                attempt + 1, maxRetries);
            
            // Simple delay for non-network errors
            await Task.Delay(delay, cancellationToken);
        }
    }
    
    _logger.LogWarning("Failed to refresh user info after {MaxAttempts} attempts", maxRetries);
}
```

##### 4.4 Add Window Focus Refresh Method
Add this public method after the `GetIsUserLoggedInAsync` method (after line 137):
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Enables automatic refresh of user info when the application window gains focus.
/// </summary>
public void EnableWindowFocusRefresh(Observable<bool> windowActiveObservable)
{
    _windowFocusRefreshDisposable?.Dispose();
    
    _windowFocusRefreshDisposable = windowActiveObservable
        .DistinctUntilChanged()
        .Where(isActive => isActive)
        .Throttle(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1)) // Prevent rapid refreshes
        .SubscribeAwait(async (_, cancellationToken) =>
        {
            try
            {
                // Only refresh if we have a cached value (user is logged in)
                if (_cachedUserInfo.Get() is not null)
                {
                    await RefreshUserInfoWithRetry(cancellationToken);
                }
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                _logger.LogDebug(ex, "Failed to refresh user info on window focus");
            }
        }, AwaitOperation.Sequential, configureAwait: false);
}
```

##### 4.5 Update Dispose Method
Modify the existing `Dispose` method (lines 211-215) to dispose of new subscriptions:
```csharp
public void Dispose()
{
    _verifySemaphore.Dispose();
    _observeDatomDisposable.Dispose();
    _periodicRefreshDisposable.Dispose();
    _windowFocusRefreshDisposable?.Dispose();
}
```

#### Dependencies:
- IWindowManager interface from NexusMods.App.UI.Windows
- R3 Observable patterns for event handling
- ILogger for error logging
- Existing CachedObject<UserInfo> implementation

### File: `/src/config/IUserSettings.cs`

#### Purpose:
Update configuration interface to support new refresh settings.

#### Changes:

##### 4.6 Add New Configuration Properties
Add these properties to the interface (after line 45):
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Whether to enable automatic background refresh of user authentication
/// </summary>
bool EnableBackgroundRefresh { get; set; }

/// <summary>
/// Whether to refresh user info when application window gains focus
/// </summary>
bool EnableWindowFocusRefresh { get; set; }
```

## 5. Risk Analysis

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- Window focus events firing multiple times rapidly
- Failed refresh operations during backoff period
- Concurrent refresh attempts from different triggers

### Potential Issues:
1. **Performance Degradation**: Frequent refresh operations could impact application performance
   - **Mitigation**: Implement proper backoff logic and ensure refresh operations are non-blocking

2. **UI Thread Blocking**: Refresh operations might block the UI thread if not properly implemented
   - **Mitigation**: Use async/await patterns and ensure operations run on background threads

### Rollback Plan:
If issues arise during implementation:
1. Revert changes to LoginManager.cs
2. Remove any added dependencies or fields
3. Restore original constructor signature
```

Write the plan to `PLAN.md` file.

**NEVER** automatically execute the plan without the user's approval.

You must ultrathink for the solution and use reasoning.
You must consider edge cases and follow best coding practices for everything. Never do bandaid fixes.

The user will provide a prompt file path as the argument.
