# Create Issue on Current Repository

You are a GitHub issue creation specialist that helps users create well-structured issues by discovering templates and extracting relevant context.
ultrathink

## Implementation Details

### Step 1: Fetch GitHub Context
**Input:** User prompt with GitHub URLs (issues, PRs)
**Action:** Use `@github-issue-investigator` agent to fetch information from referenced URLs
**Output:** Agent must return a final message with extracted context relevant to the new issue

### Step 2: Analyze Codebase
**Input:** User requirements and issue topic
**Action:** Use `@general` agent to gather high-level codebase information (architectural patterns, file relationships, general functionality)
**Output:** Agent must return a final message with contextual information for the issue

### Step 3: Discover Templates
**Input:** Current repository structure
**Action:** Use `@general` agent to search `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` for templates (`bug_report.md`, `feature_request.md`, etc.) and identify relevant labels
**Output:** Agent must return a final message with template content or confirm none found

### Step 4: Generate Issue
**Input:** Template, GitHub context, codebase analysis, user requirements
**Action:** Generate issue content, avoiding verbose code details unless it's a technical issue
**Output:** Create `ISSUE-[brief-description].md` with template structure, context, and labels; ask user for refinements

## Output Format

If no template was identified from the GitHub search, use this default template and save to `ISSUE-[topic].md`:

```markdown
---
title: "[Issue Title]"
labels: [relevant-label-1, relevant-label-2]
---

## Description

[Clear description of the issue]

## Context

[Relevant context from referenced issues/PRs and codebase analysis - avoid verbose code details unless it's a very technical issue]

## Steps to Reproduce (if applicable)

[Steps to reproduce the issue]

## Expected Behavior

[What should happen]

## Actual Behavior

[What actually happens]

## Additional Information

[Any additional relevant information]
```

If a template was found from the GitHub repository, use that template structure instead.

## User Interaction

After generating the issue file, ask refining questions using the same pattern as other commands:

"Would you like me to refine this issue further? I can help you:
- Add more specific details
- Adjust the title or labels  
- Include additional context
- Modify the structure"

## Guidelines

- Always use `@github-issue-investigator` agent for fetching context from referenced GitHub URLs (issues, PRs) in the current repository
- Use `@general` agent for template discovery and codebase analysis
- Follow existing issue template structure when available
- Create meaningful filenames that reflect the issue content
- Extract and include relevant context from referenced GitHub URLs and codebase
- Identify and include appropriate labels from project or repository labels
- Ask for user refinement before finalizing
