## Guidelines

- Be thorough but organized - use sections to maintain readability
- Include all relevant technical details
- Provide context for complex changes
- Document any decisions or trade-offs made
- Include references to related issues or discussions
- Remove sections that don't apply but keep all that do
- Do not include bug fixes for new functionality in this PR; as those were never in a released version.

After analyzing the changes, write the summary to `PR-SUMMARY.md` and confirm the file is ready for GitHub.
